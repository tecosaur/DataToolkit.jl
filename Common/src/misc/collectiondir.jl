Return the root directory for `collection`. In most cases, this will simply be
the directory of the collection file, the two exceptions being:
- When the directory is `"Data.d"`, in which case the parent directory is given
- When `collection` has no path, in which case the current working directory is used
  and a warning emitted (once only per collection).
