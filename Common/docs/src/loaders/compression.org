decompression of data, specifically the following eponymous drivers:

=IO= or =String= to =Vector{UInt8}= or =String= are also supported.

* Required packages

+ =CodecZlib=, for the following drivers:
  - =gzip=
  - =zlib=
  - =deflate=
+ =CodecBzip2= for the =bzip2= driver
+ =CodecXz= for the =xz= driver
+ =CodecZstd= for the =zstd= driver

* Parameters
