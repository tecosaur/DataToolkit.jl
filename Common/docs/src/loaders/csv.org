#+title: CSV

* Description

The =csv= driver enables the *parsing* and *serialisation* of CSV data and various
tabular data formats.

* Input/output

The =csv= driver expects data to be provided via =IO=.

By default this driver announces support for parsing to three data types:
+ =DataFrame=
+ =Matrix=
+ =CSV.File=

Other =Tables= compatible types are of course supported, and can be used directly
(i.e. without having to use the =CSV.File= result) by specifying the type with the
=support= transformer keyword.

When writing, any type compatible with =CSV.write= can be used directly, to any
storage backend supporting =IO=.

* Required packages

+ =CSV=

* Parameters

+ args :: keyword arguments to be provided to =CSV.File=

* Usage examples
