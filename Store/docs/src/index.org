#+title: DataToolkitStore

Together, [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkit.jl/core/][DataToolkitCore]] and [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkit.jl/common/][DataToolkitCommon]] provide a convenient way of
obtaining data. However, what about the second and third time you want to access
the same data set? What if you have a large data set referenced in multiple
projects, do you really want several identical copies?

These are the concerns that =DataToolkitStore= sets out to address, by providing
an central (managed) content/recipe-addressed store of data sources.

* Design

The management will be based on an "Inventory file" that contains all the
requisite information on the data collections being stored. Management will
occur automatically when the interacting with the store, but management
functions will also be made available in the form of an API, and REPL commands.

* API
