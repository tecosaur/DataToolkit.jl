#+title: Introduction

DataToolkitCommon takes the skeleton provided by [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkit.jl/core/][DataToolkitCore]] and builds the
basic functionality needed to make [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkit.jl/main/][DataToolkit]] actually useful.

To gain an understanding of how these two components fit together, it is
recommended the [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkit.jl/core/][DataToolkitCore]] docs be looked at first to understand the
system, and then these docs for useful transformers and plugins to actually work
with your data.

Note that in addition to being displayed here, you can also view the
documentation of the various drivers in the =data>= REPL like so:

 loader transformers (<count>)
   [...]
 writer transformers (<count>)
