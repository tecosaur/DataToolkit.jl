The way DataToolkit actually interacts with datasets in through /transformers/.

#+begin_details "Applying a category theory lens"
If we consider storage locations (storage), raw data (data), and informative
representations of the data (information) to be /categories/, then if you squint a
bit the =storage=, =loader=, and =writer= transformers can be viewed as functors.

This doesn't make much of a practical impact, but I think it's a fun way of
framing things.
